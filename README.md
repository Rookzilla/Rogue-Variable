Stealth games are a passion of mine. 

This repo is C++ (Mainly) Based modification for the source engine using Valves popular source SDK as a template. Runs out of a depriciated code editor with specific modifications (VS 2013). Initially inspired by games like Dishonored, this seeks to add leaning and sneaking through manipulation of the dot product vision ranges for NPCs within the game, up to but not limited to Soldiers and minor bad guys, stuff like that..

I wanted to bring this concept as a proof of concept, you can see it working here on this youtube video!
